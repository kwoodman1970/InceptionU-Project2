# InceptionU Project&nbsp;2&nbsp;&ndash; Calgary Fit Friends

[Project&nbsp;1](https://github.com/kwoodman1970/InceptionU-Project1) was
almost entirely about creating a back-end with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) with some
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) thrown in.  Project&nbsp;2 was about
creating a front-end with [React.js](https://react.dev/) and
[Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/), as well as learning how to collaborate in a
team on GitHub.

The intent was to create an application that would allow people to create
ad-hoc, pop-up physical activities in and around
[Calgary](https://www.calgary.ca/).  It would pull data from the [City of
Calgary's Open Data](https://data.calgary.ca/) & use a map interface to set the
activity's location, and the weather forecast from a meteorological service.

I was the team's leader, mentor, consultant and project manager.  The other
team members were new to software development, so I did my best to help them
level up.

We didn't get very far.

That's okay, though, because this was a fail-now-fly-later project.  This was
the opportunity to learn new things before the rubber hit the road with
Project&nbsp;3.

My main contribution to this project's code was an
[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification and a user
login/authentication system.

Personally, with this project, my key learning points were:

- React & Vite
- Basics of [Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/)
- [Trello](https://trello.com/)
- Collaboration through GitHub
- Some lessons cannot be taught &ndash; they must be experienced or realized
- How to hack [Discord](https://discord.com/) to get a user's profile picture
  &ndash; and find a hidden job offer
