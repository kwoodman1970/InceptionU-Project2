# InceptionU Project 2

## 1.  The Assignment

On Project 2 Launch Day (April 3, 2023), we were all given the following assignment:

> ### Purpose: To create a full stack app that addresses a unique challenge or problem.
>
> We understand and can demonstrate:
>
> - Computer programming involves the writing of **logic** to solve a **business problem**.  Included are loops, variables, decisions, functions and results.
> - Modern web applications are composed of **layers**, each layer has a distinct set of **responsibilities**.
> - Design and development is an iterative, reflective process.
> - Breaking down problems into their smallest component is how you accomplish big things. **“Eat an elephant one bite at a time.”**
> - **Code is disposable** – do not get attached.
> - Learning new or unfamiliar technologies is a natural part of the process of development.
> - Curiosity about learning and exploring new things is an essential part of being an effective developer.
> - Software is a team sport.  **Be involved** and **lean in**.
> - Begin with the end in mind.  **Prioritize** the approach to problem and value to the user.  There is never enough time to do everything you can imagine.
> - Applying **standards** to complex ideas is the basis for making sound decisions and is necessary to have the most accurate view of what is actually happening.
> - The **agile mindset** of the team members and how things are organized significantly impacts the success of the team and quality of the work.
> - Great software is built by great teams who **communicate clearly** and **openly**.
> - The internet is your friend (and sometimes *not* your friend).

We were then put into teams and given some time to come up with a project to work on.

My team included [Zack](https://github.com/JZackSpringChief/) and [J.J.](https://github.com/Astrognarly/)  Since I had the most experience, I assumed a leadership role and made it my goal to develop my teammates' coding skills.  My project management skills were rustier than a midwest American factory, so this would be a growing opportunity for me as well.
