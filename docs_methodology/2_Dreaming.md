## 2.  Dreaming

We spent some time thinking about what we wanted to create.  Some of the ideas that we came up with were:

- An app to let friends/family request sidewalk-shoveling, yardwork, pet care request services for elderly/infirm
- Gamify bottle recycling:  Easter Egg hunt for bottles/cans lying around on the ground
- Jobs app for students
- Short-term rentals

We eventually decided on an app that would bring people together for ad-hoc, pop-up fitness activities around Calgary.

We met together for a few hours each day for a couple of days to spend some time thinking about what this app could do and how it could work.  The plan was to start by dreaming big, then narrow down our focus into manageable features to develop.  Nothing was off of the table at this point, and it didn't matter if we strayed into the realm of silliness from time to time &ndash; after all, sometimes the best ideas come from that realm, don't they?

These are the notes of the ideas that we came up (we wanted to make use of [The City of Calgary's Open Data](https://data.calgary.ca/); features that we thought could use this data source are marked in **boldface**):

---

### Concepts to Convey to Audience:

- Snapchat for Fitness &amp; Healthy Living?
- During COVID = Passive Living...<br />
  After COVID = ACTIVE Living!
- Rebuild Your Good Habits<br />
  Rebuild Your Mental Wellness<br />
  Rebuild Your Healthy Lifestyle<br />
  Rebuild Your Community<br />
  Rebuild Your Self!

    - F(lexible)
    - A(ctive)
    - D(ynamic)!!!"

### Impromptu/No Commitment Aspects:

- Reservoir Dogs-style anonymous sign-ups for the 1st initial activity (e.g., Mr. White, Mr. Pink)?
- No need to share personal info, just pick up and play
- No need to sign up to use app – registering your email and creating a username is a turnoff for a lot of people (annoying + privacy concerns), or just enough effort to not be worth trying a new app (unless recommended by a trusted individual)
- If a further ongoing friendly relationship is desired, then share names after the 1st initial ad-hoc activity?
