## 3. Identifying the Problem

We would need to give a 15 minute presentation about our project on April 10, 2023.  These are the guidelines that we were given:

> **Purpose**:  For the teams to present the idea that they have chosen for Project 2.  During each team’s presentation, they will have a chance to share their idea, answer questions, and get feedback from the rest of the cohort.
>
> 1. **Present** (5-10 min):
>     - Your team name/project name
>     - Idea &ndash; what is the business problem you decided to solve
>     - Inspiration/catalyst &ndash; what inspired the team to choose this problem to solve
>     - Target audience &ndash; who would be the users of your app
>     - Market research &ndash; are you aware of other apps attempting to solve this problem, what will you do differently?
>     - Anything else you would like to share about your project idea
>     - Slides, other visuals, interpretive dance, theme song optional
>
> 2. **Questions/Feedback** (5-10 min):  This is an opportunity for the rest of the cohort to ask questions about the project idea and give some feedback
>     - Clarifying Questions &ndash; brief, factual answers
>     - Probing Questions &ndash; make the presenter pause, "hmm", "I need to think about that more"
>     - "Tell me more about…" "I’m curious to know the thinking behind..."
>     - Suggestions about what you think might be important for the team to consider
>     - What would you most want in an app like this?
>     - Note:  your team doesn't have to have the answers to every question that might come up, this is just meant to give you ideas and stimulate discussion around your idea.

### A SEXI Description

We started with a SEXI description of the problem that we wanted to tackle.

**S**tate the Problem
: Anything fun costs $12+, and people aren’t as active as they should be or connected as they could be.

**E**laboration
: COVID-19 disrupted society and we’re still recovering.  Politics has divided us a lot.  The economy has suffered.  Mental health issues have greatly increased.  People became more sedentary.

E**X**amples
: People began watching Netflix &amp; other video services.  Businesses (including fitness facilities) were shuttered and many closed.  Domestic violence has increased as people were forced to spend more time together.  Youtube personalities proliferated and promoted extreme views to get likes &amp; subscribers.  Drug abuse got worse due to stresses.  Nobody could &ndash; or wanted &ndash; to go out and do things &amp; connect with each other.  We all had extreme cabin fever.

**I**llustration
: COVID measures were like a war &ndash; there were victories but a lot of collateral damage and casualties.

This description became our touchstone for the duration of the project.  We would use it for the first when we gave our presentation.

## Describing the Project

We came up with the following details to share during our presentation:

Team Name
: Team Tech-JoKeZ (it incorporated our first initials and reflected the fact that we appreciated high-tech humour).

Idea
: An app that lets Calgarians create ad-hoc, pop-up physical activity events on a map and invite their besties/randos to join.

Inspiration/Catalyst
: We were interested in recreation activities and social engagement, and would like to promote physical activity.

Target Audience
: Calgarians looking for others to play with or exercise with.

Market Research
: Calgary Sports &amp; Social Club – our app will be free or ad-supported and less structured (more for smaller groups than teams and leagues)
