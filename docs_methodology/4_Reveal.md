## 4.  The Reveal

April 10, 2023 is when all of the teams revealed their planned projects.

### The Presentation

We quickly put together a bare-bones [slideshow](C10_Project_2_Reveals.pdf) that gave a reasonably good overview of our project.  We started by giving the SEXI description of the problem that we'd come up with the previous week, then expounded a bit more at each slide.

*While Zack and J.J. were doing most of the speaking, I was doing aerobic exercises!*  :sweat_smile:

### Feedback

These are the questions that we fielded after we finished our presentation and the answers (in *italics*) that we gave:

- Is the problem monetary or connection?  *Both.*
- Are you referring to behavioural modeling through physical activities?  So that people have a healthy mind & healthy body & feel connected?  *Yes.*
- What is the real problem &ndash; the cost of fun, or the lack of physical activity or the connections of Calgarians?  *All 3.*
- Relevance of "ad-hoc" to the problem?  *Lower barrier to entry from planning.*
- How is this different from a meetup group (on hiking, biking, etc.)?  *Comprehensiveness.*
- What external/unique problem are you trying to solve?  *Not unique, just widespread &amp; prevalent.*
- What is the deep problem?
- How is, "Nobody could &ndash; or wanted &ndash; to go out and do things & connect with each other," relevant to physical activity?
- Need more on mental health focus.

### The Definition of Success

After all of the teams presented their proposed projects, we were all asked to determine what a "successful" outcome for our projects would be.  We defined a it as:  **Groups of people will be getting together and doing physical activities together.**

However, that *wasn't* the true definition of success for our team &ndash; it was **to learn** (and I'd also set some individual learning goals for each of us).

### 5 Why’s Exercise

We were then all challenged to to drill down deeper into the problem with a 5 Why's exercise.  This is what our team came up with:

- Why does anything fun cost $12+?
    - Businesses are trying to recoup losses/repay debts incurred during the COVID closures
    - Input materials cost more
        - Supply lines are still not fully restored
        - Suppliers aren’t as fully staffed as before
- Why aren’t people as active as they should be?
    - People would rather watch video services (e.g. Netflix)
      - Habits formed during COVID restrictions
          - People had less reason to or were prevented from going out and doing things
          - Fitness facilities were closed
- Why aren’t people as connected as they could be?
    - COVID restrictions made them work from home
    - COVID restrictions gave less reason to go out
