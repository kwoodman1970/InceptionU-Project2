# InceptionU Project 2

## 6.  The Result

### Developing

We now had a clearer vision of what we were going to build.  [Zack](https://github.com/JZackSpringChief/) worked on the front end, [J.J.](https://github.com/Astrognarly/) worked mainly on the back end & a bit on the front end, and I wrote the [OpenAPI specification](../openapi.yaml) & built the React context for logging in and out.

The whole process of deciding what we'd create was rather time-consuming and we didn't get to build much of the features that we wanted, but it was a very necessary process.  I knew that we weren't going to end up with a whiz-bang product &ndash; it was more important that everyone on the team (including myself) were to level up and learn, especially since Project 3 would be when we would build real-world code for real-world clients.

### Feedback

All teams had a feeback session on April 25.  This is the protocol that we followed:

> **Purpose:**  This is a feedback protocol to fine-tune or improve each project for Demo Day on May 5, 2023.  During each round, each team will have a chance to share their work and provide feedback to the other teams in their breakout groups.
>
> 1. **Present** (~7 min):
>     - Purpose of the project &ndash; unique problem being addressed
>     - Target audience
>     - Ideal outcomes - what will change if this project is executed well
>     - *Guiding question* for feedback &ndash; **what does your project team need support/guidance with?**
> 2. **Clarify & Examine** (~6 min):  This is an opportunity for the feedback participants to gather additional information that is needed to **understand** the presenting team’s work better.
>     - "Tell me more about..." "I’m curious to know the thinking behind..."
>     - Feedback participants &ndash; **where does the project align, and not align, with the project purpose?**
> 3. **Ponder** (1 min):  Review and examine the project work with the **guiding question** in mind.
>     - Silent
>     - Identify alignment and misalignment with the project purpose
>         - "I appreciate", "You have done a great job with", etc.
> 	      - "I wonder"
> 4. **Separate** (30 sec):  The presenting team will now turn their chairs around and have their backs to the rest of the participants.  The presenting team members should take notes while the feedback is being given.  The feedback participants are to imagine as if the presenting team has left the room.
> 5. **Feedback Discussion** (~6 min):  Where does the work meet desired goals and provide offers, ideas, or suggestions for strengthening the work in an area defined by the focusing question.  The facilitator should ensure that **all** voices are heard.
> 6. **Reflect** (~4 min):  Invite the presenting team to turn their chairs around and speak to whatever comments/questions they choose while the feedback participants are silent.  Assure the presenting team that they do not need to comment on every point, but should use this time to **reflect** aloud on those ideas or questions that seemed particularly interesting or helpful.

*Unfortunately, I don't have the notes from this feedback session.*

### Demo Day

Demo Day was May 5, 2023.  We were given the following guidelines:

> Each team will have **15 minutes** to present and is responsible to include:
>
> 1. **USING SLIDES OR ANOTHER VISUAL TOOL, SHARE DETAILS ABOUT:**
>     - The Team
>     - The Problem
>     - The Solution
>     - The Technologies
> 2. **PRODUCT DEMO**
>     - Team will walk the audience through the **functionality** of their application
>     - Every team member **MUST** speak to the project at some point
> 3. **KEY LEARNINGS**
>     - As a team and individually, describe your key takeaways from your experience with Project 2

### The Presentation

There was no recording made of the presentations, but here's the script and the slideshow that we used.

- [Script](C10_Project_2_Demo.md)
- Slideshow ([PDF](C10_Project_2_Demo.pdf) or [PowerPoint](C10_Project_2_Demo.ppsx))

When we demonstrated our application (at the "Run Time!" slide in the slideshow), we each presented the features that we worked on.

My personal key learnings were:

-	React & Vite (useState and useContext in particular)
-	Basics of scrum
-	The need to be agile &ndash; the human body is neither rigid nor gelatinous, yet has both strength & flexibility
-	Trello
-	Collaboration through GitHub (use of branches)
-	Some lessons cannot be taught &ndash; they must be experienced or realized
-	How to hack Discord’s website to get a profile picture and a job offer
