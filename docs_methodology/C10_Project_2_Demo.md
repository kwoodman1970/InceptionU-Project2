## 0:01 The Problem
**Zack:**<br />
Anything fun costs $12+, and people aren’t as active as they should be or connected as they could be.

**J.J.:**<br />
COVID-19 disrupted society and we’re still recovering.  Politics has divided us a lot.  The economy has suffered.  Mental health issues have greatly increased.  People became more sedentary.

**Kevin:**<br />
People began watching Netflix & other video services.  Businesses (including fitness facilities) were shuttered and many closed.  Domestic violence has increased as people were forced to spend more time together.  Youtube personalities proliferated and promoted extreme views to get likes & subscribers.  Drug abuse got worse due to stresses.  Nobody could – or wanted – to go out and do things & connect with each other.  We all had extreme cabin fever.

## 0:02 The Solution

**J.J.:**<br />
- see information on where recreation activities are being held
- create pop-up recreation activities
- connect people to recreation activities
- invite others to an activity
- foster community

**Zack:**<br />
The Three Core Values (Triple A’s):<br />
- Affordable (free of charge, sharing of equipment when possible)
- Accessible (all ages & inclusive)
- Ad-hoc (impromptu & no long-term commitments)

**Kevin:**<br />
Here’s how we went about developing this app:<br />
1. Thinking about what we were all interested in and finding a common theme:<br />  connecting people through physical activities
2. Dreaming about what people would do with our app
3. Focusing on the exact ways that people would use our app
4. Considering which features we needed to implement
5. CODING!

## 0:03 The Technologies

**Zack:**<br />
We used Vite and React to build the frontend.  In React, we used “useState” to control which components are displayed and “useContext” for user authorization.
J.J:<br />
We used Node.js and express.js to build the backend and we stored user information in JSON files (because we all agreed that we hate MongoDB!).

## 0:10 Key Learnings

**Kevin:**<br />
Creating a whiz-bang app was not actually the true goal of this project.  [Throws something at center of screen at exact moment the next slide is shown] The true goal of this project was to learn, and learn we did!

**J.J.:**<br />
- Backend tech stack
- Proper syntax
- Proper variable naming conventions
- Proper importing of modules
- The importance of pre-planning
- The pitfalls of optimism
- Google & ChatGPT answers are sometimes outdated or factually incorrect = tools, not lifelines
- Collaboration is hard
- Communication is key
- Git
- GitHub

**Kevin:**<br />
- React & Vite (useState and useContext in particular)
- Basics of scrum
- The need to be agile – the human body is neither rigid nor gelatinous, yet has both strength & flexibility
- Trello
- Collaboration through GitHub (use of branches)
- Some lessons cannot be taught – they must be experienced or realized
- How to hack Discord’s website to get a profile picture and a job offer

**Zack:**<br />
- Frontend development
- GitHub
- Teamwork
- Its okay to copy and paste as long as you understand what’s going into your code
- Learning react
- File structure
- Better to be realistic
- Collaborating is fun
